Tracker Manual

Attach ticket id to time entry

In order to add a ticket entry to toggl you need to reference it like so in the time description

[touch: {ticket-id}]

e.g.

[touch: 162]

Also for time to be tracked each entry needs to have a project attached. You should have these projects populated in toggl once the project import script has ran.
